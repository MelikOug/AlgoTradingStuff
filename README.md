A very rough program designed to calculate the volume profile of time series price data at each time interval
The program plots the candlestick chart with the VPF points of control as well as lower and upper bounds calculated using peak widths
There is also the option to use various other indicators to give long/short signals on the data
The overall aim is to make a versatile backtesting program that can be changed to incorporate multiple indicators and give signals where there is confluence between them
