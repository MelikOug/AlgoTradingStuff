This Python script not only retrieves and analyses cryptocurrency trading data from the Binance API but also includes a customisable backtesting engine. 
The backtester allows users to simulate trading strategies with various options such as trailing stop loss, fixed stop loss, take profit levels, and more. 
By integrating technical indicators from TA-Lib as well as custom class methods, users can test different trading strategies in historical data scenarios. 
This feature helps evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and refine them before live deployment, providing valuable insights into risk management and potential profitability.
